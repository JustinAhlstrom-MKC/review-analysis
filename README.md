## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

**Problem:** "Token expired" or "Invalid credentials"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Delete saved token and re-authenticate
rm config/credentials/google_token.pickle
python scripts/setup_wizard.py
```

### API Access Errors

**Problem:** 403 Forbidden or "API not enabled"

**Solution:**
1. Verify APIs are enabled in Google Cloud Console:
   - My Business Account Management API
   - My Business Business Information API
   - Google Sheets API
   - Google Drive API
2. Check that OAuth credentials have correct scopes
3. Some Google My Business APIs require verification - apply at [Google My Business API setup](https://developers.google.com/my-business/content/basic-setup)

### Location IDs Not Found

**Problem:** Can't find your restaurant location IDs

**Solutions:**
1. Use `list_accounts.py` then `list_locations.py` to discover them
2. Check Google Business Profile Manager for location details
3. Ensure you're authenticated with the correct Google account
4. Verify you have permission to access the business locations

### 7shifts API Issues

**Problem:** Can't connect to 7shifts or no employees returned

**Solution:**
1. Run `test_7shifts.py` to diagnose the issue
2. Verify API key and Company ID in `.env`
3. Check that API key has correct permissions in 7shifts settings
4. Ensure you're using the correct company ID

### Sheet Not Updating

**Problem:** Reviews aren't syncing to Google Sheet

**Solution:**
1. Check logs in `logs/` directory for error messages
2. Verify Sheet ID is correct in `.env`
3. Ensure the Google account has edit permissions on the sheet
4. Try running with verbose logging: `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`

### Missing Dependencies

**Problem:** Import errors when running scripts

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
