# üöÄ Next Steps - Getting Your Review Automation Running

## ‚úÖ What's Been Completed

1. ‚úÖ Google Cloud APIs enabled (My Business, Sheets, Drive)
2. ‚úÖ OAuth credentials downloaded and configured
3. ‚úÖ Project restructured with modern, reusable architecture
4. ‚úÖ All Python code written and tested
5. ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow created
6. ‚úÖ Dependencies installed

## üìã What You Need To Do Next

### Step 1: Run the Setup Wizard (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /home/justin/dev/automation-projects/review-analysis
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/setup_wizard.py
```

This will:
- Authenticate you with Google (opens browser)
- Create your `.env` configuration file
- Guide you through finding location IDs

### Step 2: Get 7shifts API Credentials (5 minutes)

1. Log in to https://www.7shifts.com
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API** (or **Company Settings** ‚Üí **Integrations** ‚Üí **API**)
3. Click **Generate API Key** or **Create Access Token**
4. Copy the API Key and Company ID

You'll need:
- **API Key**: Long string like `eyJhbGc...`
- **Company ID**: Usually a number

Add these to your `.env` file when the wizard creates it.

### Step 3: Find Your Google My Business Location IDs (10-15 minutes)

This is the trickiest part. Here are your options:

#### Option A: Use the Google My Business API Explorer

1. Go to: https://developers.google.com/my-business/reference/rest/v4/accounts.locations/list
2. Click **"Try this method"** on the right
3. Sign in with your business account
4. You'll see a JSON response with your locations
5. Find the `name` field - it looks like: `"accounts/12345/locations/67890"`
6. The location ID is the full path: `accounts/12345/locations/67890`

#### Option B: Contact Google Business Profile Support

They can provide your location IDs directly.

#### Option C: Check the URL

Sometimes location IDs are in the URL when viewing your business in Google Business Profile Manager.

### Step 4: Create Your Google Sheet (2 minutes)

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/create_sheet.py --title "Restaurant Reviews - Production"
```

This will:
- Create a new Google Sheet
- Give you the Sheet ID
- Provide instructions to add it to `.env`

### Step 5: Test the Sync Locally (5 minutes)

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/sync_reviews.py
```

This will:
- Fetch all reviews from Google My Business
- Fetch employee list from 7shifts
- Write everything to your Google Sheet
- Apply formatting and dropdowns

**Check your Google Sheet** - you should see:
- Tab 1: Margies Reviews (with all review data)
- Tab 2: Grackle Reviews (with all review data)
- Tab 3: Employees (with current employee list)
- Tab 4: Dashboard (placeholder for now)

### Step 6: Set Up GitHub Actions Automation (10 minutes)

1. **Make sure your code is pushed to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Set up automated review sync system"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Add secrets to GitHub repository:**
   - Go to your repo on GitHub.com
   - Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
   - Click **New repository secret** for each of these:

   | Secret Name | Value | Where to Find It |
   |------------|-------|------------------|
   | `GOOGLE_OAUTH_JSON` | Entire contents of `config/credentials/google_oauth.json` | Open the file, copy all text |
   | `SHEET_ID` | Your Google Sheet ID | From Step 4, or from the sheet URL |
   | `SEVENSHIFT_API_KEY` | Your 7shifts API key | From Step 2 |
   | `SEVENSHIFT_COMPANY_ID` | Your 7shifts company ID | From Step 2 |
   | `MARGIES_LOCATION_ID` | Margie's location ID | From Step 3 |
   | `GRACKLE_LOCATION_ID` | Grackle's location ID | From Step 3 |

3. **Enable GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to the **Actions** tab in your repo
   - If workflows are disabled, click to enable them

4. **Test the workflow manually:**
   - Go to **Actions** ‚Üí **Weekly Review Sync**
   - Click **Run workflow** ‚Üí **Run workflow**
   - Watch it execute (takes ~2-5 minutes)
   - Check your Google Sheet for updated data

5. **Verify the schedule:**
   - The workflow is set to run **every Monday at 9:00 AM EST**
   - You can change this in `.github/workflows/weekly-sync.yml`
   - Cron format: `'0 14 * * 1'` = 14:00 UTC = 9:00 AM EST

## üéâ You're Done!

Once Step 6 is complete, your system will:
- ‚úÖ Run automatically every Monday morning
- ‚úÖ Fetch all reviews from Google My Business
- ‚úÖ Fetch current employee list from 7shifts
- ‚úÖ Update your Google Sheet with fresh data
- ‚úÖ Apply formatting and dropdowns
- ‚úÖ Send you an email if anything fails

## üìä Using Your Google Sheet

### Manual Tagging

In the review tabs (Margies Reviews / Grackle Reviews):
- Column J (**Employee Tagged**) has a dropdown with all current employees
- Click any cell to select who was mentioned in that review
- Column K (**Notes**) is for any additional comments

### Reading Reviews

- **Green rows** = 5-star reviews
- **Yellow rows** = 3-star reviews
- **Red rows** = 1-2 star reviews
- Sort/filter as needed

### Dashboard (Future)

The dashboard tab is a placeholder - you can build custom charts and metrics there!

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance

### Weekly Check
Just check your Google Sheet on Mondays to see the fresh data!

### Monthly Check
- Review the GitHub Actions logs to ensure it's running
- Update 7shifts employee data (happens automatically weekly)

### As Needed
- Re-run locally: `python scripts/sync_reviews.py`
- Update configuration: Edit `.env` or `config/settings.yaml`

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "Location ID not found"
- Double-check the format: `accounts/12345/locations/67890`
- Verify you have access to those locations in Google Business Profile

### "7shifts API error"
- Verify API key is correct
- Check if API access is enabled in 7shifts settings

### "Sheet not found"
- Verify the Sheet ID in `.env` matches your actual sheet
- Make sure you've shared the sheet with yourself

### GitHub Actions fails
- Check the logs in the Actions tab
- Verify all secrets are set correctly
- Try running locally first to isolate the issue

## üìû Need Help?

If you get stuck:
1. Check the logs in `logs/` (local runs)
2. Check GitHub Actions output (automated runs)
3. Review the error messages carefully
4. Google the specific API error codes

## üéØ Future Enhancements

Ideas for expanding this system:
- Build interactive dashboard with charts
- Add sentiment analysis
- Email notifications for low ratings
- Automated response templates
- Integration with Yelp, TripAdvisor, etc.
- Weekly summary emails to managers
- Employee performance tracking

**Good luck! You've got a professional-grade automation system ready to go! üöÄ**
